# person-follower

A silly project to detect and follow people using computer vision on a Raspberry Pi. This will likely snowball into a creepy robot head that follows people around the room.

## Aims

1. Detect people in a video stream.
2. Track people in a video stream as they move.
3. Follow people in a video stream using a servo motor.
4. Infer the project onto a Raspberry Pi.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the program using `python follower/follower.py`.
